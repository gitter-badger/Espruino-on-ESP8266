# Espruino-on-ESP8266
This is a temporary project. A goal is to run the Espruino JavaScript (github.com/espruino) built with the Xtensa under esp-open-sdk (github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) directly on ESP8266 wifi module.

All the code changes for now are "dirty", source files and headers are in ./user/. Once it pass the tests, we are going to contribute to Espruino repository.

To do:
- Implement hardware specifics.
- Implement file system for loading JS files from flash.

Current status:
- Upload and run main.js (flash memory address 0x60000)
- Evaluate JS code from serial port (115200 baud).
- GPIO functionality implemented.

Example - toggle GPIO2:
var gpio2 = new Pin(2);
gpio2.write(!gpio2.read());

# How to run Espruino on ESP8266?

esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x00000 firmware/0x00000.bin 0x10000 firmware/0x10000.bin

# How to upload & run JavaScript code?

Customize your code in js/main.js and flash it:

esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x60000 ./js/main.js
