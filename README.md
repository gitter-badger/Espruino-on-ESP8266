# Espruino-on-ESP8266
This is a temporary project. A goal is to run the Espruino JavaScript (github.com/espruino) built with Xtensa - esp-open-sdk (github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) directly on ESP8266 wifi module. All the code changes are dirty, sources and headers are in user/. Once it will pass the tests, I will contribute to Espruino repository.
